Could do more collision detection with the sample on dropbox,
PlatformerWithRamps.zip in V2 map

TODO:
* Camera
* Larger maps
* Animation (sprites)
* Gamepad control
* Ramps (for the map)
* TileEditor needs to set that the tile is sloped and what direction, also what kind of slope (start with 45 degrees)
* TileEditor - Layer type (which is solid)
* Smaller hitbox for player (then sprite size)
* Backgrounds (Parallax support)
* Edit backgrounds in TileEditor
